The project follows the presentation website of Alter World Simula, a Platform side-scroller video game developed in JavaScript.

The websiteâ€™s purpose is to serve as a portal for the game, containing both the game in a landing page, as well as to provide promotional material, guides and even a recruitment form for people who want to join the development of the project.
